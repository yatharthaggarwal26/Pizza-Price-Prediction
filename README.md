# Pizza-Price-Prediction
This project is to predict the price of pizza. First I performed exploratory data analysis then I used Decision Tree and Random Forest for model fitting. For accuracy of the model R^2 score was calculated.
Library used:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
xgboost
Accuracy of models:
Model	R2 Score
Decision Tree	98.76
Random Forest	94.56
